# mkdd-text-maker
Used to easily make mkdd text
Type in the text, and adjust the spacings, and hit the button.
The text will always be 32 pixels tall, unless the vertical scaling is changed. 
You have the option to save as a .png (for dolphin texture hacks) or a .bti (for editing the .iso itself)

# Special Thanks
Thanks to Cherry for makign the prefix images
