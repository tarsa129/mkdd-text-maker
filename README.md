# mkdd-text-maker
Used to easily make mkdd text for custom tracks and characters. <br>
Type in the text box and adjust the spacings. All changes will be made automatically. Post-processing in an image editor is required for changes such as changing alignment, adding color, etc. <br> 
You have the option to save as a .png or a .bti. Saving as a .bti requires [Wiimm's SZS Tools](https://szs.wiimm.de/download.html) to function. Double-clicking on the image will copy it to the clipboard, although the background will be gray.
